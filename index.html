      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am going to start my doctoral career at the <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/">Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.hku.hk/">The University of Hong Kong</a>, under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/~yuanwei/">Yuanwei Liu</a>. 
        Prior to that, I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the <a href="https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ee/">School of Eletronic and Information Engineering</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/">South China University of Technology</a>, in Jun. 2022 and Jun. 2025, respectively. My recent research focuses on 
        Performance analysis, evaluation and optimization for wireless communication systems, mobile networking and protocols. I have recently developed
        a Python-based simulation platform for UAV communication networks named "UavNetSim-v1" [<a href="https://github.com/Zihao-Felix-Zhou/UavNetSim-v1">Project link</a>], 
        which provides accurate modeling and simulation of packet transmissions within mobile networks, and supports users to design and verify their own protocols and algorithms. 
        I really enjoy my research and if you are interested in my work or have any questions, feel free to reach out via email at <a href="mailto:eezihaozhou@gmail.com">eezihaozhou@gmail.com</a>.
